Research in the lab is focused on two major areas:<br><br>
<b>Defining epigenome changes in cancer progression and understanding epigenetic basis for therapeutic responses</b><br><br>

We have recently characterized epigenome changes in melanoma progression using high-throughput ChIP-Sequencing approach. We are currently mapping epigenomic maps from well-characterized tumor samples as well as those that have been treated with different therapeutic agents to better understand chromatin states associated with disease phenotype as well as therapeutic responses.<br><br>

<b>Identifying and delineating mechanisms of epigenetic factors that drive cancer progression and therapeutic responses</b><br><br>

Another major effort in the lab revolves around identifying epigenetic factors involved in different stages of cancer progression as well as those that modify therapeutic responses. We utilize unbiased RNAi and overexpression screening approaches in mice using orthotopic transplantation of relevant modified primary or tumor cells as well as PDX models. This is followed by mechanistic studies to better define the cellular processes being affected by epigenetic alterations.<br><br>

Finally, we are building mouse models for different tumor types based on the genetic alterations in epigenetic machinery to better understand roles of these potential epigenetic drivers of tumorigenesis.
